# TGM Masters Timer
A ChatGPT fuelled "tool" to help run a masters-style TGM tournament. If you don't know what that means you probably don't need this.

## Usage
Go to [https://d4nin3u.github.io/masters-timer/](https://d4nin3u.github.io/masters-timer/).

For development, make sure you have npm/pnpm and `npm run start`.

`/docs` is the build output directory since that's what GitHub supports as a GitHub pages source dir.
