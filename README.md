# TGM Masters Timer
A ChatGPT fuelled "tool" to run a masters-style tournament. If you don't know what that means you definitely don't need this.

## Usage
Compile with typescript, or don't.
Usually I wouldn't include the dist/ folder since that's build output but since this is acessible via github pages I didn't want to bother making a new branch I'll probably forget to maintain immediately.
